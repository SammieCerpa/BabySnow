This website will contain numerous and different coding projects that I will be doing in this coding class. 

Hello everyone, my name is Samantha Cerpa and some of my favorite pass times involve reading scary stories in the dark, eating endless amounts of chocolate chip cookies, and putting a positive smile on everyone's faces. Oh! I also love Fall out Boy music and Big Hero 6.
